Lowering collection costs means more complete archives.

Our custom software runs on commodity pc hardware / linux and uses consumer grade SDRs. It is capable of capturing any radio spectrum from 100 Khz to 6 Ghz, equipped with real-time, software-based demodulation capabilities for AM, FM, HD radio, and SSB. It can perform these functions at a fraction of the cost of industry standard methods, which often require one tuner per channel or multi-tuner cards. We can collect the entire FM or AM band (as [quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-phase_and_quadrature_components#I/Q_data) data) with a single software defined radio. All of this with zero commercial license dependencies or monthly fees. All processing takes place on the appliance so no internet access is required even when real-time speech-to-text transcription is configured. This enables extremely remote deployments.
